# Python Speech Assistant

My first time working with speech recognition and text-to-speech and it was a great experience and very informative. This is a Python app that uses speech recognition and the Google text-to-speech API

### Dependencies

```
pip install speechrecognition
pip install gTTS
pip install pyaudio
pip install playsound
pip install PyObjC
```

```
pip install PyAudio
```

If you find any issue with installing PyAudio on MacOS please see [here](http://www.cdotson.com/2019/03/installing-pyaudio-on-macos/)

### Voice Commands

These are the commands that are currently available to use with the speech assistant.

- What is your name?
- What time is it
- Search
- Find Location
- Exit

### Future Development

In the future I would like to add more commands and broaden the functionality such as searching particular webpages to bring back certain information.
